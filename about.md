# About

Navya is a group of students interested in improving the standard and quality of computing of campus. Consequently, it is often observed that Navya has set out to make FOSS/linux more popular, both in typical day-to-day use as well as in development related application. Legend has it that the hidden agenda of Navya was and still is to conquer the world - we choose not to comment on that belief. 

Navya was started by a bunch of [kids](people#alumni) for a bunch of [kids](http://students.iitk.ac.in) and is now being run by another bunch of [kids](people#current) offering various [services]() to the kids on the campus.

Since we cater to the needs of the campus major works can be accessed from our [internal wiki](http://navya.junta.iitk.ac.in).

We hang out at `#navya` at `freenode`. You are most welcome to join us there. You can also mail us your suggestions and criticism at [navya@students.iitk.ac.in]() or better yet, contribute those changes at [github](http://github.com/navya).

FLOSS everyday! ;)
