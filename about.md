# [index](/) &raquo; About

Navya is a group of students interested in improving the standard and quality of computing of campus. Consequently, it is often observed that Navya has set out to make FOSS/linux more popular, both in typical day-to-day use as well as in development related application. Legend has it that the hidden agenda of Navya was and still is to conquer the world - we choose not to comment on that belief. 

Navya turned dormant in 2016. Now that we are in 2021, Navya is back again. We are working to get the wiki and internal sites back working again.

Navya was started by a bunch of [kids](/people#alumni-members) for a bunch of [kids](http://students.iitk.ac.in) and is now being run by another bunch of [kids](/people#current-members) offering various [services](/services) to the kids on the campus.

Since we cater to the needs of the campus major works can be accessed from our [internal wiki](http://navya.junta.iitk.ac.in).

We hang out at `#navya` at `freenode`. You are most welcome to join us there. You can also join our mailing list at let us know of your questions, suggestions and criticism at [navya@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/navya) or better yet, contribute those changes at [github](http://github.com/navya).

FLOSS everyday! ;)
