<h1><a href="../">index</a> Â» About</h1>
<p>Navya is a group of students interested in improving the standard and quality of computing of campus. Consequently, it is often observed that Navya has set out to make FOSS/linux more popular, both in typical day-to-day use as well as in development related application. Legend has it that the hidden agenda of Navya was and still is to conquer the world - we choose not to comment on that belief.</p>
<p>Navya was started by a bunch of <a href="../people#alumni-members">kids</a> for a bunch of <a href="http://students.iitk.ac.in">kids</a> and is now being run by another bunch of <a href="../people#current-members">kids</a> offering various <a href="../services">services</a> to the kids on the campus.</p>
<p>Since we cater to the needs of the campus major works can be accessed from our <a href="http://navya.junta.iitk.ac.in">internal wiki</a>.</p>
<p>We hang out at <code>#navya</code> at <code>freenode</code>. You are most welcome to join us there. You can also join our mailing list at let us know of your questions, suggestions and criticism at <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/navya">navya@googlegroups.com</a> or better yet, contribute those changes at <a href="http://github.com/navya">github</a>.</p>
<p>FLOSS everyday! ;)</p>
